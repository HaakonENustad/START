Hi all,

Thanks for a productive startup meeting in the START project. 

Here follows a short summary of the meeting; 

We shortly discussed the software and infrastructure that would be needed to do the normalisation on TSD, and decided for now to start implementing the QC pipeline using the RnBeads R-package, but knowing that there are other alternative methods that could be used. However, since the pipeline should be very transparent and “light” on the data, different QC wrappers should give the same results. 

The key programers for the pipeline implementation will for now be: William, Haakon N, Juila, and Yunsung, with some oversight and help from me and Robert. 

We will aim to have a working pipeline ready and tested with 10-20 EPIC samples by the end of April, so that once the iDats are shipped from the lab, the pipeline are ready to revived them and can produce files usable for researchers. 

The main deliverables from the QC should be:
1) An easy accessible data set of quality controlled DNA methylation data from the Trios
2) A portable pipeline for doing QC on FHI project involving the EPIC array
3) A good documentation of the QC, where each step is described
4) A flow chart for each exclusion of any samples or probes
5) A standard material and methods section that can be included in any paper using this data
6) Outline a Cohort Profile for the trio design and ART DNA methylation cohort 

Any ideas for papers and project should be e-mailed to Siri, who would be coordinate this. 

A slak group has now been activated where we can keep track of the progress and tasks 

I have also initiated a GitHub repos for the START project on the FHI GitHub page here;  https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/START this is very empty for now, but if you send me your GitHub username, I will add you to the project. 

I’ll call in for a meeting around early February
